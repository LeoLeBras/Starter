A starter template for effective HTML / CSS (Sass) / JS (es6+) website.

### Getting started

# Install

Just [clone](github-windows://openRepo/https://github.com/LeoLeBras/website-starter-kit.git) the repo
and start :

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/LeoLeBras/website-starter-kit.git myAvesomeProject
$ cd myAvesomeProject
$ npm install                   # Install Node.js components listed in ./package.json
```
Think to install gulp in global on your desktop : `npm i gulp -g`, if this has not been done before.

# How to start the dev mode ?

```shell
$ npm start                     # or: gulp dev
```

This will start a lightweight development server (browsersync dev server) with live reloading.
